  <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

  <h2>1. Data Protection at a glance</h2>

  <h3>General information</h3>
  <p>
    The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal information when
    you visit our website. Personal information is any information that personally identifies you.
    For detailed information on the subject of data protection, please refer to our data protection
    declaration listed below this text.
  </p>

  <h3>Data collection on our website</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      The data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator.
      Their contact data can be found in the imprint of this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      How do we collect your data?
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    On the one hand, your data is collected by you communicating it to us.
    This may, for example, involve data that you enter in a contact form.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other data is automatically collected by our IT systems when you visit the website.
    This is primarily technical data (e.g. Internet browser, operating system or time of page call).
    This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      What do we use your data for?
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Part of the data is collected to ensure that the website is error-free.
    Other data can be used to analyse your user behaviour.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      What rights do you have with regard to your data?
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    You have the right at any time and free of charge to obtain information about the origin,
    recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to request that
    this data be corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time at the address
    given in the imprint for this as well as for further questions on the subject of data protection.
    Furthermore, you have the right to appeal to the responsible supervisory authority.
  </p>
  </p>
    In addition, you have the right, under certain circumstances, to demand the restriction of the
    processing of your personal data. For details please refer to the data protection declaration
    under &bdquo;Right to limitation of processing&ldquo;.
  </p>

  <h3>Analysis Tools and third-party Tools</h3>
  <p>
    When you visit our website, your surfing behaviour can be statistically evaluated.
    This is done primarily with cookies and so-called analysis programs. The analysis of your
    surfing behaviour is usually anonymous; the surfing behaviour cannot be traced back to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using certain tools. Detailed information
    on these tools and your opt-out options can be found in the following privacy statement.
  </p>

  <h2>2. General Information and mandatory Information</h2>
  <h3>Data Protection</h3>
  <p>
    The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
    We treat your personal data confidentially and according to the legal data protection
    regulations as well as this data protection explanation.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is data
    with which you can be personally identified. This Privacy Policy explains what information
    we collect and how we use it. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail)
    can be subject to security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties
    is not possible.
  </p>

  <h3>Reference to the responsible office</h3>
  <p>The responsible body for data processing on this website is:</p>
  <p>Leon Ebel<br />
    Gollierstr. 78<br />
    80339 Munich
  </p>
  <p>E-Mail: kontakt@ebelleon.de</p>

  <p>
    The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on
    the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
  </p>

  <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
  <p>
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke your
    consent at any time. For this purpose, an informal e-mail notification to us is sufficient.
    The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
    revocation.
  </p>

  <h3>Right of objection against data collection in special cases and against direct advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>
      If data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO, you have the
      right at any time to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons arising from your
      particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective
      legal basis on which a processing is based can be found in this data protection declaration.
      If you file an objection, we will no longer process your personal data concerned unless we can
      prove compelling reasons for the processing worthy of protection which outweigh your interests,
      rights and freedoms or the processing serves the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims
      (objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO).
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      If your personal data are processed for the purpose of direct advertising, you have the right
      to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising;
      this also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected with such direct advertising. If you
      object, your personal data will no longer be used for direct marketing purposes (objection
      according to Art. 21 para. 2 DSGVO).
    </strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
  <p>
    In the event of infringements of the DSGVO, the persons concerned have the right to appeal
    to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence,
    workplace or place of presumed infringement. The right of appeal shall be without prejudice
    to other administrative or judicial remedies.
  </p>

  <h3>Right to Data transferability</h3>
  <p>
      You have the right to have data which we process automatically on the basis of your consent or
      in fulfilment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable
      format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible person, this will
      only be done as far as it is technically feasible.
  </p>

  <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
  <p>
    This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of
    confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator.
    You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser
    changes from &bdquo;http://&ldquo; to &bdquo;https://&ldquo; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.
  </p>
  <p>
    If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
  </p>

  <h3>Information, blocking, deletion and correction</h3>
  <p>
    Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free
    information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and the purpose of data
    processing and, if applicable, a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data. You can
    contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint for this and other questions on the
    subject of personal data.
  </p>

  <h3>Right to limitation of processing</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint. The right to restriction
    of the processing exists in the following cases:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to
        verify this. For the duration of the examination you have the right to demand the restriction
        of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>

      <li>
        If the processing of your personal data has taken place unlawfully, you may demand that the
        data processing be restricted instead of deleted.
      </li>

      <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal
        claims, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
        instead of deletion.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 DSGVO, a balance must be struck
        between your and our interests. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests predominate,
        you have the right to demand that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may only be processed -
    apart from their storage - with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal
    claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
    an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
  </p>

  <h2 id='cookies'>3. Data Collection on our website</h2>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>
    The Internet pages partly use so-called cookies. Cookies do not damage your computer and do not
    contain viruses. Cookies serve to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and safer.
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer by your browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the cookies we use are so-called &bdquo;session cookies&ldquo;. They are automatically deleted at
    the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your terminal until you delete them.
    These cookies enable us to recognize your browser during your next visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and only allow
    cookies in individual cases, accept cookies for certain cases or generally exclude them and
    activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated,
    the functionality of this website may be restricted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide certain
    functions requested by you (e.g. shopping basket function) are stored on the basis of
    Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a justified interest in the storage of
    cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of its services. Insofar as other
    cookies (e.g. cookies for analysing your surfing behaviour) are stored, these are dealt with
    separately in this data protection declaration.
  </p>

  <h3>Contact Form</h3>
  <p>
    If you send us enquiries via the contact form, your details from the enquiry form including
    the contact data you provided there will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the
    enquiry and in the event of follow-up questions. These data will not be passed on without your
    consent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore carried out exclusively on
    the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke this consent at any time.
    For this purpose, an informal e-mail notification to us is sufficient. The legality of the data
    processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data entered by you in the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion,
    revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies
    (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions
    - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Analysis Tools and Advertising</h2>

  <h3>Matomo (formerly Piwik)</h3>
  <p>
    This website uses the open source web analysis service Matomo. Matomo uses so-called &bdquo;cookies&ldquo;.
    These are text files that are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of the use of the
    website by them. For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie about the use of this
    website is stored on our server. The IP address is anonymised before it is stored.
  </p>
  <p>Matomo cookies remain on your terminal until you delete them.</p>
  <p>
    The storage of Matomo cookies and the use of this analysis tool are based on Art. 6 para.
    1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a justified interest in the anonymous analysis of
    user behaviour in order to optimise both his website and his advertising.
  </p>
  <p>
    The information generated by the cookie about the use of this website is not passed on to third
    parties. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
    however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do not agree with the storage and use of your data, you can deactivate the storage and use
    here. In this case, an opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser to prevent Matomo from storing
    usage data. If you delete your cookies, the Matomo Opt-Out-Cookie will also be deleted.
    The opt-out must be reactivated when you visit our site again.
  </p>

  <div class='optOut'>
    <input type='radio' name='matomoPreference' id='enableMatomo' checked />
    <label for='enableMatomo'>Matomo aktivieren</label>

  <h2>5. Plugins and Tools</h2>

  <h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>
  <p>
    This page uses so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts.
    The Google Fonts are installed locally. There is no connection to Google servers.
  </p>

  <h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
  <p>
    We use the map service of OpenStreetMap (OSM). Provider is the Open-Street-Map Foundation (OSMF),
    132 Maney Hill Road, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B72 1JU, United Kingdom.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you visit a Web site that includes OpenStreetMap, your IP address and other information
    about your behavior on that Web site will be shared with OSMF, among other things. OpenStreetMap
    may store cookies in your browser for this purpose. These are text files which are stored on your
    computer and which enable an analysis of your use of the website. You may refuse the use of cookies
    by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you
    may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your location can also be recorded if you have permitted this in your device settings, e.g. on your
    mobile phone. The provider of this page has no influence on this data transfer. Details can be
    found in the OpenStreetMap privacy policy under the following link:
    <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy' target='_blank' rel='noopener nofollow'>
      https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The use of OpenStreetMap is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online services
    and an easy retrieval of the locations indicated by us on the website. This represents a legitimate
    interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO.
  </p>

  <h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
  <p>
    We use &bdquo;Google reCAPTCHA&ldquo; (hereafter &bdquo;reCAPTCHA&ldquo;) on our websites. The provider is Google
    Ireland Limited (&bdquo;Google&ldquo;), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on our websites (e.g. in a contact form)
    is made by a person or by an automated program. To this end, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of
    the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as
    soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various
    information (e.g. IP address, length of stay of the website visitor on the website or mouse
    movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reCAPTCHA analyses run completely in the background. Website visitors are not informed
    that an analysis is taking place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate
    interest in protecting his web offers against abusive automated spying and against SPAM.
  </p>
  <p>
